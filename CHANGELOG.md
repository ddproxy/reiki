# Changelog

## 0.1.2

### Added

- Optional admin listener with `GET /status` (per-key state, cooldown time left, per-stream chain) and `GET /metrics` in Prometheus format.
- Optional per-stream rate limit, `rate_limit_per_minute`.
- Per-upstream `model_aliases` and `drop_params` body rewrites.
- Key health persisted next to the config as `<config>.state`, so cooldowns and out-of-rotation keys survive a restart.
- `quota_resets` per key, to end a quota cooldown at the provider's next reset instead of a fixed 5 h.
- `Retry-After` values given as HTTP dates are honoured.

### Fixed

- A SIGHUP reload no longer replays the state file, which could revive the disabled flag of a key whose secret had just been rotated.
- State writes are serialised, so an older snapshot cannot overwrite a newer one.
- A poisoned internal lock no longer turns every request into a 503.
- Plain `http://` upstreams are accepted only for the exact hosts `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` and `[::1]`, not for lookalike names.
- Restored cooldowns are capped at a year, so a hand-edited state file cannot overflow a timestamp.
- The declared minimum Rust version is now 1.99. It was 1.85, which the locked dependencies did not actually build on (they needed 1.88).
